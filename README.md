# Credit Cards Canada App - for Nesto Coding test

This app was made for Nesto coding test.

# Background 

This React app utilizes Credit Cards Canada API ( http://creditcardscanada-api.herokuapp.com/ ). It's an open API project built by myself to create an credit cards ranking web app. Currently it has information of 4 banks and the data was obtained by webscraping using Beautiful Soup.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
